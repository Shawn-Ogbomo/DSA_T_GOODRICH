R-1.1 Which of the following is not a valid C++ variable name? (There may be
more than one.)
a. i_think_i_am_valid
b. i_may_have_2_many_digits_2_be_valid
c. I_start_and_end_with_underscores
d. I_Have_A_Dollar_$ign
e. I AM_LONG_AND_HAVE_NO_LOWER_CASE_LETTERS

answer: d 

Write a pseudo-code description of a method for finding the smallest and
largest numbers in an array of integers and compare that to a C++ function
that would do the same thing.

values  -5 -10 -4 -2 -1

min = num[0]

max = num[0]

for int i = 1 ; i < sz_arr ++i

    if min > next 
        min = next 
    end if 

    if max < next 
        max = next 
    end if 

end for


R-1.4 What are the contents of string s after executing the following statements.
    string s = "abc";
string t = "cde";
s += s + t[1] + s;

"abcabcdabc"

R-1.5 Consider the expression y + 2 * z ++ < 3 - w / 5. Add parentheses
to show the precise order of evaluation given the C++ rules for operator
precedence.

 y + (2 * z ++) < 3 - (w / 5)

 R-1.6 Consider the following attempt to allocate a 10-element array of pointers
 to doubles and initialize the associated double values to 0.0. Rewrite the
 following (incorrect) code to do this correctly. (Hint: Storage for the
 doubles needs to be allocated.)

 R-1.10 What (if anything) is different about the behavior of the following two
functions f and g that increment a variable and print its value?
void f(int x)
{
    std::cout << ++x;
}
void g(int &x)
{
    std::cout << ++x;
}

answer : Yes.One functions target object is passed by value and the other by reference.The former denotes that the value is immaterial and the latter will be mutated.
